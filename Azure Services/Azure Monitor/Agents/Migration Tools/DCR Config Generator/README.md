# What is the DCR Generator ?

The `workspaceConfigToDcrMigrationTool` or `DCR generator` in the context of MMA config to AMA config migration is a **powershell script**  
that helps users convert their Log Analytics agent configuration stored in workspaces to corresponding Data Collection Rules (DCR) configuration.

It is a standalone script and doesn't require the installation of any additional dependencies.
